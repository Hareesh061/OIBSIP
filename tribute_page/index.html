    <h2 id="bio">Biography</h2>
    <p id="bi" style="color:white"> <strong style="font-size:20px">Ratan Tata</strong>, in full <strong style="font-size:20px">Ratan Naval Tata</strong>, (born December 28, 1937, Bombay [now Mumbai], India), Indian <br>businessman who became chairman (1991–2012 and 2016–17) of the Tata Group, a Mumbai-based conglomerate.<br> <br>
        A member of a prominent family of Indian industrialists and philanthropists (see Tata family), he was educated at<br> Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, where he earned a B.S. (1962) in architecture before returning to work in<br> India.
         He gained experience in a number of Tata Group businesses and was named director in charge (1971) of <br>one of them, the National Radio and Electronics Co. He became chairman of Tata Industries a decade later and in<br> 1991 succeeded his uncle, J.R.D. Tata, as chairman of the Tata Group.<br><br>

        Upon assuming leadership of the conglomerate, Tata aggressively sought to expand it, and increasingly he focused <br>on globalizing its businesses. In 2000 the group acquired London-based Tetley Tea for $431.3 million, and in 2004 <br>it purchased the truck-manufacturing operations of South Korea’s Daewoo Motors for $102 million. In 2007 Tata <br>Steel completed the biggest corporate takeover by an Indian company when it acquired the giant Anglo-Dutch steel<br> manufacturer Corus Group for $11.3 billion.<br><br>
        
        In 2008 Tata oversaw Tata Motors’ purchase of the elite British car brands Jaguar and Land Rover from the Ford<br> Motor Company. The $2.3 billion deal marked the largest-ever acquisition by an Indian automotive firm.The<br> following year the company launched the Tata Nano, a tiny rear-engined, pod-shaped vehicle with a starting price<br> of approximately 100,000 Indian rupees, or about $2,000. Although only slightly more than 10 feet (3 metres)<br> long and about 5 feet (1.5 metres) wide, 
        the highly touted “People’s Car” could seat up to five adults and, in Tata’s<br> words, would provide a “safe, affordable, all-weather form of transport” to millions of middle- and lower-income <br>consumers both in India and abroad. In December 2012 Tata retired as chairman of the Tata Group. He briefly ser<br>-ved as interim chairman beginning in October 2016 following the ouster of his successor, Cyrus Mistry. Tata re<br>-turned to retirement in January 2017 when Natarajan Chandrasekaran was appointed chairman of the Tata Group.<br><br>
        
        Among many other honours accorded him during his career, Tata received the Padma Bhushan, one of India’s most<br> distinguished civilian awards, in 2000. <br>
